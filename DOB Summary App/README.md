Problem Statement

Design an application that will perform the following actions:
1.      Prompt the user and read in user date of birth in (mm/dd/yyyy) format.
        - Program checks if date is in correct format. Provides proper message if incorrect format is entered and repeats 1.
        - If user enters wrong data for three consecutive times then system exits with proper notification.

2.      System prints following summary from the date of birth:
        - What day of the week they were born? e.g. "You were born on a Friday."
        - Their Zodiac sign. e.g. "Your zodiac sign is capricorn."
